                      I'm a creative front-end developer with a passion for crafting modern, responsive, and user-focused web experiences. My journey began with a love for design and grew into a deep curiosity about how the web works—blending logic, aesthetics, and functionality to bring ideas to life.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, refining my projects, and discovering better ways <br> to make the web faster, more efficient, and more engaging.
                     I believe in continuous learning, attention to detail, and the impact of clean, meaningful design in shaping exceptional digital experiences.
